README

The paper can be divided into three parts. The respective folders each contain a specific README file that guides through reproducing our results. 

1. Lorenz curve estimation using MLE and NLS on a US county and state level. Relevant code can be found in the respective folder including .csv files with estimated Ortega parameters on a US county and state level.

2. Ortega Lorenz curve simulation to investigate what features about the income distribution each of the parameters capture. The folder also provides an R Shiny application to facilitate Ortega parameter interpretation.

3. An exploratory study correlating the Ortega parameters to other county-level characteristics. Relevant code is provided in the respective folder.
