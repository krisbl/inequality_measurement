Simulation of Ortega Lorenz curves to investigate what features of the income distribution the parameters capture: 
The simulation can be rerun using the code simulation_ortega_lorenz_curves.R which also produces relevant figures that can be found in the supplementary material.

Simulation of Ortega Lorenz curves to determine relationship between Ortega parameters and 90/50, 50/10 ratios: The simulation can be rerun using the code percentile_ratios_ortega_parameters.R

Rshiny_Ortega_LC.R provides an Rshiny tool that facilitates interpretation of the Ortega parameters.
