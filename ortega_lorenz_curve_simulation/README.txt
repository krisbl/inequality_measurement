README - Simulation of Ortega Lorenz curves to investigate what features of the income distribution the parameters capture

The simulation can be rerun using the code simulation_ortega_lorenz_curves.R which also produces relevant figures that can be found in the supplementary material.

Rshiny_Ortega_LC.R provides an Rshiny tool that facilitates interpretation of the Ortega parameters.
